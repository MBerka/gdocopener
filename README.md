# gdocopen
Python-based application to open Google Docs (gdoc) files created on and by Dropbox. It will only work if you have an internet connection. 

Linux

Copy gdocopen.desktop to /usr/share/applications.
You will need superuser priviliges, so use 'sudo cp [SOURCE] [DEST]'.

run sudo chmod a+x gdcopen.desktop

select gdcopen as default app for gdoc files

According to this thread, Google do not plan to have a client on Linux any time soon:

Windows

Google's Backup and sync solves the problem, so I highly recommend to install it.
If you do not want to install Backup and sync, here is what you have to do.
